# fcc - World Cup Database Project

This is just the repository needed for completing the fcc project. It contains the database file with all the necessary tables created but no data in them + the script files used to fill the data in the tables, as well as the script file with some queries.

More information about the actual project can be found on [freeCodeCamp's website](https://www.freecodecamp.org) under the Relational Database section of the Cirriculum.
